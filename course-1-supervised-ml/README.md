# Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning  
**Andrew Ng – Machine Learning Specialization (Coursera)**

This repository contains my **from-scratch implementations and learning notebooks**
based on **Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning – Regression and Classification**
from Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Specialization.

The focus of this course is to build a **strong foundation in supervised learning**
by understanding both the **mathematical intuition** and the **practical implementation**
of core machine learning algorithms using Python.
